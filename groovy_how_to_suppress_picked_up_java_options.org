#+title: How to suppress the message Picked Up _JAVA_OPTIONS when starting Groovy

On Arch Linux, with Groovy 2.5+, when starting /Groovy/ via
=/usr/bin/groovy= or =/usr/bin/startGroovy=, the /JVM/ will output a
message to =stderr= that cannot be suppressed:

#+begin_example
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=gasp
#+end_example

This is because that variable is defined in both of the aforementioned
scripts. Unsetting it is possible by creating the file
=$HOME/.groovy/startup=, which is sourced by =/usr/bin/startGroovy=:

#+begin_src sh
# $HOME/.groovy/startup

unset _JAVA_OPTIONS

# vim: ft=sh
#+end_src
