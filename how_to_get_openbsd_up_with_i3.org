#+title: How to get OpenBSD up and running with i3wm

* The OpenBSD installer

** Keyboard layout

In the /Choose your keyboard layout/ prompt, type in =br= (Brazilian)
and hit /Enter/.

** xenodm

From a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/f40mq0/why_startx_does_not_work_for_nonroot_users][reddit post]]:

#+begin_quote
The =setuid= bit was removed from the *X* server for security reasons
which meant that =startx(1)= no longer works, it is recommended to use
=xenodm(1)= instead.
#+end_quote

In the /Do you want the X Window System to be started by xenodm(1)?/
prompt, type in =yes= and hit /Enter/.
