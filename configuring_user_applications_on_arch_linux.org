* Configuring user applications on Arch Linux

** lxde, The Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment

*** Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcut mappings reside in
=~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml=. Once you've edited them, make
=openbox= aware by running:

~openbox --reconfigure~

*** Desktop entries

To add a custom Desktop Entry, create a =.desktop= file in
=~/.local/share/applications=.

The following is an example of an entry for a generic _LXDE_ screen
locker. (I had to create it once, because I removed the default one
from the rightmost launcher.)

#+begin_src conf
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Screen Locker
Comment=Lock your screen
Icon=system-lock-screen
Exec=lxlock
Categories=Settings;DesktopSettings
#+end_src

For your changes to be picked up, run:

~lxpanelctl restart~
