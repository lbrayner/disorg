Openbox is a highly configurable, next generation window manager with

#+END_QUOTE

Since /Openbox/ is just a window manager, you need to manually install
some other essential graphical applications, such as a terminal
emulator and a panel. And don't forget to install /Xorg/, because it
isn't pulled y default.

#+begin_src sh
sudo pacman -S xorg-server openbox obconf tint2 nitrogen \
    rxvt-unicode lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter
#+end_src
