* Installing user applications on Arch Linux

** Firefox

~sudo pacman -S firefox~

If you've followed the *How to get Arch Linux up and running for
Junior Developers* guide, when you install this package, you'll be prompted
to choose one provider of true type fonts, because, at this point,
there isn't any.

** VNC server and viewer

- =x11vnc=: a _VNC_ server implementation;
- =xorg-server-xvfb=: a virtual framebuffer X server.

~sudo pacman -S x11vnc xorg-server-xvfb~

Preferably we want to attach to an instance of =Xvfb= that will match
our monitor's specifications.

*** Attaching to an existing X session

Supposing it's a session on a real monitor started by a regular user
(e.g. =guilherme=), you'll want to connect to display =:0= like this:

~x11vnc -display :0 -localhost -auth ~/.Xauthority~

The client must have an implementation of the _VNC_ client installed,
such as =tigervnc=.

On the client, start an =ssh= connection with port 5900 forwarded to
*localhost*, port 5900, on the target machine:

~ssh -L 5900:127.0.0.1:5900 guilherme@host~

Finally, on the client, start the _VNC_ viewer:

~vncviwer 127.0.0.1~
